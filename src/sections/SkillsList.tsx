            I use a variety of technologies and tools for web development. I primarily use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front-end of my websites. For back-end development, I rely on PHP and MySQL. I also use frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery to help streamline my workflow and make coding easier.
            </p>
            <p>
            Additionally, I often utilize version control systems such as Git to manage code changes and collaborate with other developers. Finally, I regularly employ various web development tools such as Chrome Developer Tools or Postman for debugging purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, these technologies and tools provide me with the necessary capabilities to develop high-quality websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
            </p>
            <p>
            Due to the highly accelerated changes of the tech-driven workforce that have occurred over the past few years, the web development landscape has dramatically shifted.

            Tools and technologies used
            </h3>
            <p className="pt-3"><strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript: </strong>The fundamental trio for web development services used to create the structure, style, and interactivity of web pages.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Frameworks: </strong>Including React, Angular, and Vue.js, which streamline development and enhance the functionality of web applications, making them more dynamic and responsive.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Backend Technologies: </strong>PHP frame works(Laravel, CodeIgniter),  Node.js for server-side JavaScript, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL for databases, which handle data management and ensure smooth operation behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): </strong>Visual Studio Code and PHPStorm provide powerful tools for coding, debugging, and project management.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Version Control Systems: </strong>Git(GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket) essential for collaborative development, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously while maintaining code integrity.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Responsive Design Tools: </strong>Including Bootstrap and Foundation, facilitating the creation of websites and applications that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Testing and Debugging Tools: </strong>Chrome DevTools, Postman, Xdebug and laravel unit testing, aiding in the identification and resolution of bugs and performance issues throughout the development process.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Package Managers:</strong> I used npm and Yarn, simplifying the process of installing, managing, and updating third-party libraries and dependencies.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools: </strong>I used CI and CD pipelines in Azure DevOps work together to automate the software development and delivery process. CI focuses on integrating code changes and ensuring a stable codebase, while CD handles the deployment of applications to various environments, enabling frequent and reliable software releases.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Protocol/Platform/Containerization tools:</strong> I love to use windows machine with WSL(Ubuntu). SSH and HTTP are the protocols commonly used by me. When it comes to containerization tool I have been using Docker for localization of projects or setting up of development environment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Management tools tools:</strong> Azure DevOps, Jira and Trello are the project management tools that I have been using for my projects.
            </p>
            <p className="pt-5 fst-italic py-3">
            In conclusion, these tools and technologies form the backbone of web development services, empowering developers to create engaging and functional web experiences for users across the globe.
